# Third-party notices

This document identifies upstream AITER and incorporated third-party components, their source references,
licenses, and local paths. Paths are relative to the repository root. Individual source-file copyright
and license notices apply to their respective portions; AMD and Hygon contributions retain their own attribution.
Files with unresolved provenance or missing source-file copyright attribution are listed separately under "待溯源".

## AMD AITER

- Upstream project: [ROCm/aiter](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter), `main`.
- Source reference: [AITER commit `552f4b85124b77b22db40223209ac1e19140d4d6`](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter/tree/552f4b85124b77b22db40223209ac1e19140d4d6).
- Copyright: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
- License: [MIT](LICENSE), subject to the component-specific licenses below.
- Local coverage: AITER-derived Python modules, C/C++ operators, tests, and build code across this repository.
- Local adaptations: Hygon GPU kernels, operator integration, communication, and build/JIT support.

The source reference identifies an upstream distribution of the incorporated code. The local project
also contains subsequent upstream changes and Hygon adaptations.

## Incorporated third-party components

The tables identify incorporated portions, not necessarily the whole-file origin. A file may appear
under more than one component. Upstream source references preserve the references recorded in the
code; a moving branch or PR is not a fixed import version. Missing import revisions are explicitly
unconfirmed and must not be inferred from a copyright year or a current upstream license.

AMD comparison snapshots: [552f4b8](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter/tree/552f4b85124b77b22db40223209ac1e19140d4d6)
and [354e278](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter/tree/354e278e5b46dba462c73c91cc3d2252164eb224).
An AMD comparison link establishes the available redistribution/comparison copy, not the original
third-party import commit. Modification statements compare local implementations to that named
copy; they do not attribute every difference to Hygon. Existing AMD and Hygon notices apply to
their respective contributions. Apache portions use [LICENSE.Apache-2.0](LICENSE.Apache-2.0);
other component terms are linked separately below.

### vLLM

The local files `csrc/kernels/activation_kernels.cu` and `csrc/kernels/quant_kernels.cu` declare `Apache-2.0 AND MIT`: Apache terms and vLLM attribution from the earlier AMD redistribution are retained alongside later AMD MIT notices and the project MIT terms for Hygon contributions. The expression records cumulative obligations, not a choice of license. The earlier Apache copy also credits AMD; copyright ownership alone does not divide the file into Apache and MIT portions. These sources are incorporated into compiled AITER extensions and distributed with the kernel sources; this is source incorporation, not merely a runtime dependency on the vLLM package. See [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.Apache-2.0) and [MIT](LICENSE).

- Project / repository: [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
- Copyright: The vLLM team / contributors to the vLLM project, as stated in the individual files.
- License: [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.Apache-2.0) for vLLM portions; `aiter/dist/parallel_state.py` is distributed under MIT in the fixed AMD AITER source.

References to the ROCm and monellz forks identify intermediate source repositories. Direct vLLM import revisions remain unconfirmed except where an explicit reference is supplied. The MIT-only headers in `aiter/ops/triton/chunked_pa_prefill.py` and `op_tests/triton_tests/utils/rotary_embedding.py` do not establish the license of their cited vLLM portions; that notice reconciliation remains open.

The two `scalar_type.py` references identify matching implementations. Their contributor attribution follows [vLLM v0.9.1](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/v0.9.1/vllm/scalar_type.py); actual import commits and intermediate repositories remain unconfirmed.

### SGLang

The local `op_tests/triton_tests/utils/mla_extend_ref.py` retains the SGLang Apache terms together with the MIT notice carried by the AMD redistribution, recorded as `Apache-2.0 AND MIT`. Its reference implementation matches the fixed AMD copies below; no Hygon implementation changes are identified. It is incorporated test source, imported by the test utilities package. Retaining the AMD MIT notice does not replace the SGLang Apache terms or establish that the inherited implementation was relicensed. See [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.Apache-2.0) and [MIT](LICENSE).

- Project / repository: [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
- Copyright: SGLang Team (including the 2023-2025 notices retained locally); additional owners follow the source notices.
- License: [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/4cb53ecd0cffceb6dee5c011a58f65997a86f151/LICENSE) for SGLang portions.

The TopK transform Python wrappers, original tests, and interface declarations derive from SGLang `sgl-kernel`; the baseline GPU kernel also derives from its TileLang-based implementation. The applicable SGLang terms are Apache-2.0, retained alongside MIT for the TileLang portions and Hygon implementation changes where present. File headers state the applicable combination and modification scope; the declaration-only header remains Apache-2.0. Fixed comparison copies are [`b8ddc296f448`](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/b8ddc296f448307e17e6da15ebbe660f1f1ca4aa/sgl-kernel) and [`51e2eaa45801`](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/51e2eaa45801fb7090ebef91ebd866043ec232b0/sgl-kernel); the exact upstream import revision remains unconfirmed. The component LICENSE supplies `Copyright 2023-2024 SGLang Team`; `sgl_kernel_ops.h` carries its own 2025 SGLang notice. See [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.Apache-2.0) and [MIT](LICENSE).

PR numbers identify development references, not fixed import commits. `mla_decode_rope.py`, `prefill_attention.py`, and `utils/mla_decode_ref.py` retain SGLang Apache notices alongside MIT SPDX identifiers; the scope of the MIT contributions needs reconciliation. Other MIT-only local headers do not replace SGLang portion licensing.

### RAPIDS RAFT

The vectorized traversal in `csrc/include/topk_transform_hcu.cuh` derives from the RAFT traversal implementation also carried by historical AITER TopK sources. The historical AITER copy retains a comment naming the RAFT helper; the function structure and scalar/vector head-tail handling correspond to the upstream implementation. This is source incorporation, not a runtime dependency.
